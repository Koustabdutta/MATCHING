## 🧠 MATCHING – String Similarity & Fuzzy Matching with Python

This notebook demonstrates **string similarity matching** techniques using Python libraries like **FuzzyWuzzy** and **difflib**. It is designed to identify near-duplicate or similar strings — useful in data cleaning, record linkage, and text preprocessing tasks.

### 🔍 Key Features
- Fuzzy matching using FuzzyWuzzy (Levenshtein Distance)  
- Sequence matching using difflib  
- Match scoring and ranking between input strings  
- Works well for typos, partial matches, and misspellings  
- Interactive and educational Jupyter notebook format  

### 📁 File
- `MATCHING.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete matching logic and examples

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
